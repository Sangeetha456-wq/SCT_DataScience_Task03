Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
In this task, I have built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.
The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset, which contains information about direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.
It includes attributes such as:

Age

Job

Marital status

Education

Account balance

Previous campaign outcome

Subscription to a term deposit (target variable)



ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries Used

Google Colab

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Decision Tree Classifier

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables

Split the dataset into training and testing sets


ðŸ”¹ Model Building:

Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn

Trained and tested the model on the prepared dataset


ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation:

Evaluated performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualized the Decision Tree for interpretability



âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a Decision Tree Classifier can be used to predict customer purchase behavior.
The model effectively highlights important factors influencing whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit, such as previous campaign outcomes and customer demographics.

Thank you for reviewingÂ myÂ submission!
